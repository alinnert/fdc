# Fonto Dev Companion

This is a web based UI that helps you configure XML schemas for FontoXML.

It scans `.xsd` files for element definitions and tells you if there are any `configureAs*()` calls or `insert_contextual-*` operations for each of them.

## Install

```
npm i -g @alinnert/fdc
```

## Usage

Run the command `fdc` in your project directory.
